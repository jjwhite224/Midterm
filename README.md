#Jelani White Midterm
I wanted to iterate on my first assignment because I liked the visuals I produced and wanted to see what I could do with them. 
I enjoy glitch art and worked with Ascii filters before in p5.js so I was glad to see in pixi I could simply use filters to achieve a glitchy aestitc. For interaction I randomized the colors everytime the user clicks and added a gui option that changes the size of the ascii characters font.
